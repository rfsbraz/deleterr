# Deleterr Configuration Guide

This guide provides a detailed explanation for each configuration setting you'll need to set up Deleterr.

You can find a sample configuration file in the [config](../config) directory.

Fields marked with **\*** are mandatory and must be configured.

## General Settings

General settings set at the root level of the configuration file.

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `dry_run` | If true, actions are only logged, not performed. | `true` |
| `plex_library_scan_after_actions` | Trigger a Plex library scan after actions are performed. | `false` |
| `tautulli_library_scan_after_actions` | Trigger a Tautulli library scan after actions are performed. | `false` |
| `action_delay` | Delay (in seconds) between actions. Defaults to `0`. Sometimes the Plex/Sonarr/Radarr instances start to timeout when the delay is set to zero (specially if deleting remote media). Increase this to prevent errors | `25` |

<details>
  <summary>See example</summary>

```yaml
dry_run: false
plex_library_scan_after_actions: false
tautulli_library_scan_after_actions: false
action_delay: 0
```
</details>

## Plex *
This section holds the connection details for your Plex server. The URL is the address where your Plex server is hosted, and the token is your unique Plex authentication token.

```
</details>

## Radarr

Here, you can specify the connection settings for **one or more** Radarr instances.

You can configure multiple Radarr instances by adding additional entries to the `radarr` array (useful for 4k instances, for example)

```yaml
radarr:
  - name: "Radarr"
    url: "http://localhost:7878"
    api_key: "YOUR_RADARR_API_KEY1"
  - name: "Radarr 4K"
    url: "http://localhost:7879"
    api_key: "YOUR_RADARR_API_KEY2"
```
</details>

## Sonarr [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]

Here, you can specify the connection settings for **one or more** Sonarr instances.

You can configure multiple Sonarr instances by adding additional entries to the `sonarr` array (useful for 4k instances, for example)

## Trakt

If you use Trakt, this section is where you provide your Trakt application details. This is necessary for integration and fetching data from Trakt. The client ID and client secret can be obtained by [creating an application](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications) on Trakt's website.

trakt:
  client_id: "YOUR_TRAKT_CLIENT_ID"
  client_secret: "YOUR_TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET"
```
</details>

### Library

For each of your Plex libraries, specify how you want Deleterr to behave. Define the name of the library, which instances to use, the action mode, and various thresholds related to watched status and addition date. You can also define exclusion rules here to protect certain media items from being actioned.

| Property | Description | Example |  Supported Values |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `name` | Name of the Plex library you wish to manage. Must match the name of your Plex Library | `"Movies", "TV Shows", "Anime` | - |
| `radarr` | Identifier of the Radarr instance to be used for this library (matches a `name` under the `radarr` configuration). Exclusive with the `sonarr` property | `"Radarr", "Radarr 4K"` | - |
| `sonarr` | Identifier of the Sonarr instance to be used for this library (matches a `name` under the `sonarr` configuration). Exclusive with the `radarr` property | `"Sonarr", "Sonarr 4K"` | - |
| `series_type` | Only used if `sonarr` is set. It's required to filter for the show type, defaults to `standard`. | `"standard", "anime"` | `standard`, `anime`, `daily` |
| `action_mode` | The action to perform on the media items. | `delete` | `delete` |
| `last_watched_threshold` | Time threshold in days. Media watched in this period will not be actionable | `90` | - |
| `watch_status` | Watch status. Media not in this is state will not be actionable | `-` | `watched`, `unwatched` |
| `apply_last_watch_threshold_to_collections` | If set to `true`, the last watched threshold will be applied to all other items in the same collection. | `true` | `true` / `false` |
| `added_at_threshold` | Media that added to Plex within this period (in days) will not be actionable | `180` | - |
| `disk_size_threshold` | Library deletion will only happen when below this threshold. It requires a `path` (that the `sonarr` or `radarr` instance can access) and a size threshold | `path: /media/local` </br> `threshold: 1TB` | Valid units: [`B`, `KB`, `MB`, `GB`, `TB`, `PB`, `EB`] |
| `max_actions_per_run` | Limit the number of actions performed per run. Defaults to `10` | `3000` | - |
| `sort_config.field` | Field to sort media list by. Defaults to `title`	 | `title` | `title`, `size`, `release_year`, `runtime`, `added_date`, `rating`, `episodes`, `seasons` |
| `sort_config.order` | Direction to sort media list by. Defaults to `asc`  | `asc` | `asc`, `desc` |

<details>
  <summary>See example</summary>

```yaml
libraries:
  - name: "Movies"
