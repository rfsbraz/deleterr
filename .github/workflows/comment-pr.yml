                    :robot: A Docker image for this PR is available to test with:
                    
                    ```bash
                    docker run -e LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG --rm -v ./config:/config -v ./logs:/config/logs ghcr.io/rfsbraz/deleterr:pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
                    ```

                    This assumes you have a `config` and `logs` directory where you're running the command. You can adjust the volume mounts as needed.
